## Assignment 7

I turned this in and was done with it, but then I made the mistake of editing the .yml and .qmd to resolve a library issue because I got an email that the git action failed and then it all broke and I couldn't merge it so I deleted all of it and it still wouldn't merge and I deeply regret messing with it.
